Welcome to the GitHub Workshop!
One day I went to the store to buy some groceries. I was the confronted by a man who said that I shouldn't be buying groceries,
as I had no hands. Now, this was true, but I wasn't happy with how nonchalantly he pointed it out. Me being a forgiving god,
I decided that I would take mercy on him and disintegrate him without him feeling any pain.
